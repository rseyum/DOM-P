            >LORD POLONIUS: Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The
            wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for.
            There; my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory
            See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any
            unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means
            vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple
            them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with
            entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware Of
            entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear't that the opposed may
            beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; Take each
            man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy
            purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the
            apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank
            and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither
            a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and
            friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all:
            to thine ownself be true, And it must follow, as the night the day,
            Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing
            season this in thee!</span

            fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature,

            suppliance of a minute; No more.</span

            >LAERTES: Think it no more; For nature, crescent, does not grow
            alone In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, The inward
            service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you
            now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his
            will: but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his
            own; For he himself is subject to his birth: He may not, as unvalued
            persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety
            and health of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be
            circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is
            the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far
            to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his
            saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes
            withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, If with too
            credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste
            treasure open To his unmaster'd importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear
            it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out
            of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal
            enough, If she unmask her beauty to the moon: Virtue itself 'scapes
            not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of the spring,
            Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, And in the morn and
            liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary
            then; best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none
            else near..</span
